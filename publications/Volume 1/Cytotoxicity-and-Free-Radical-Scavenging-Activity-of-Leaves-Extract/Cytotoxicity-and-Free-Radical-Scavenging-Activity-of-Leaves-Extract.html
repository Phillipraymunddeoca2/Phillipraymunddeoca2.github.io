<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2><p class="text-justify">This research study utilized four fundamental stages of examination, beginning with phytochemical analysis and concluding with protocol-based testing on the mitotic arresting activity of the Phyllanthus acidus (Bangkiling) leaves extract utilizing the Onion Root Tip Assay. The Onion Root Tip Assay was performed to determine the Phyllanthus acidus (Bangkiling) leaves extract&#39;s mitotic arresting activity. Bangkiling leaves were evaluated for their free radical scavenging activity using the DPPH Scavenging Assay and their cytotoxic activity using the Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay. Bangkiling leaves extract has an IC50 of 7.27 mg/ml. The extract is cytotoxic, with an LC50 of 455.02 g/mL. Additionally, the results indicate that Bangkiling Leaf Extract has the same potential as commercially available colchicine tablets. Bangkiling Leaves and Ascorbic Acid were both equally effective at neutralizing free radicals. As a result, it could be employed as a low-cost, organic, and environmentally benign plant-based chemotherapy.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p class="text-justify">Cancer is the world&#39;s second-biggest cause of mortality and morbidity, accounting for 9.6 million deaths and 9.6 million cases of illness in 2018 [1]. It is a disorder characterized by aberrant cell division, invasion, and dissemination throughout the body via the blood and lymphatic systems [2][3]. Asia is projected to account for over half of all cancer fatalities [4][5]. </p>
<p class="text-justify">Cancer is primarily caused by sedentism and pollution. The three stages of carcinogenesis are initiation, promotion, and progression [6]. Free radicals are involved in the development of cancer. Antioxidants protect cells by interacting with and destroying oxidative free radicals, making them an adjuvant chemotherapeutic agent [7]. </p>
<p class="text-justify">While chemotherapy treatments are critical in the treatment of cancer, their hazards exceed their benefits. Natural medications are difficult to come by. Numerous experts are currently researching plant-based medicines to combat cancer. Antioxidant phytochemicals reduced carcinogenesis [8]. Numerous studies have established a relationship between antioxidants and biological activity [9][10][11], for example, cytotoxicity towards tumor cells [12]. </p>
<p class="text-justify"><em>Phyllanthus acidus,</em> commonly referred to as Bangkiling in the Visayas, Philippines (11.0000° N, 123.5000° E), or simply gooseberry tree, is a fruit-bearing tree with edible little yellow berries that is a member of the Phyllanthaceae family [14]. </p>
<p class="text-justify">Despite numerous studies showing that most fruits that are rich in antioxidants have red to blue-violet color as a part of their criteria, Phyllanthus acidus’ yellow appearance is due to its richness in beta-carotene, a carotenoid with antioxidant properties; also because of its citric acid concentration and flavor, it is classed as citrus fruit [15][16][17]. </p>
<p class="text-justify">Citric acid increases the antioxidant content of meals by increasing the synthesis of antioxidant-containing nutraceutical components such as phenolic compounds and flavonoids [18] . Antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-hepatotoxic, and antiviral agents are included [19][20]. P. acidus flower&#39;s free radical scavenging and cytotoxic activity have been thoroughly examined in order to determine its potential as a cancer treatment.</p>
<hr />
<br><br>
<h2 id="Methodology">Methodology</h2><br><br>
<h3 id="Collection">Collection and Preparation of </h3><p class="text-justify">The Bureau of Plant Industry–Region VI received a fresh leaf cutting of mature <em>Phyllanthus acidus</em> (Bangkiling) from Brgy. Lacaron, Valladolid, Negros Occidental, Philippines. Ten (10) plant specimens were used for taxonomic identification. The leaves were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and shade dried for a week at room temperature. The dried leaves were then powdered. The powdered leaves (62.15g) were added and simmered at 60°C for one (1) hour. The cooled extract was vacuum filtered. The 167.8 mL filtrate was stored in a sealed glass bottle for later use.</p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="Characterization">Characterization of Bioactive Compounds of </h3><p class="text-justify">The Characterization of Bangkiling (<em>Phyllanthus acidus</em>) Leaves extract was standard and implemented following the procedures of Rahman et al. “Antibacterial, Cytotoxic and Antioxidant Potential of Methanolic Extract of <em>Phyllantus Acidus</em> L.” of the Department of Pharmacy, International Islamic University Chittagong, Bangladesh [21].</p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="DPPH">DPPH (</h3><p class="text-justify">The antioxidant activity of the extracts was determined by scavenging the stable 1, 1- diphenyl 2-picrylhyorazyl (DPPH) free radical using the method described by Brand-Williams et al., with minor modifications. 1ml of 0.1mM DPPH solution in methanol was mixed with 1ml of varying concentrations of plant extract solution (25 ppm, 50 ppm, 75 ppm, and 100 ppm). Corresponding blank samples were prepared, and reference standards of L-Ascorbic acid (10 ppm, 15 ppm, 20 ppm, 30 ppm, and 40 ppm) were used. As a control, a mixture of 1ml methanol and 1ml DPPH solution was used. The reaction was carried out in triplicate, and the decrease in absorbance at 517 nm after 30 minutes in the dark was measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The inhibition percentage was computed using the formula [22].</p>
<p class="text-justify">𝐼𝑛ℎ𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 % = 𝐴𝑐 − 𝐴𝑠 / 𝐴𝑐 × 100</p>
<p class="text-justify">Where 𝐴𝑐 is the absorbance of the control, as is the absorbance of the sample.</p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="Onion">Onion Root-tip Assay </h3><p class="text-justify">Onion Root-tip Assay was carried out to measure the Mitotic arresting potential of the plant sample. Initially, triplicates of equal size Allium cepa (onions) bulbs, 25-30mm in diameter and 20g on average, were placed in distilled water for 24 hours at 23°C and protected from direct sunlight to allow the roots to grow. After germination of roots (1.0-5.0cm in length), bulbs were exposed for 96 hours to <em>Phyllanthus acidus</em> leaves extract, Colchicine Tablet, and Distilled water collected water samples. Physical deformations of the root were observed. Mitotic arresting quantification was based on the mitotic index. [23]</p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="Brine">Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay </h3><p class="text-justify">For preliminary cytotoxicity testing of plant extracts (nauplii), the ability to kill cultured laboratory larvae is critical. For 24 hours, 30 brine shrimp nauplii were exposed to plant extracts (0, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, and 50 ppm).</p>
<p class="text-justify">After 24 hours, the test tubes were magnified against a black background to count the surviving <em>nauplii</em>. The lethality of brine shrimp nauplii at each concentration was calculated using this data. Abbott&#39;s formula was used to correct the mortality [24].</p>
<p class="text-justify">𝑃𝑡= [(𝑃𝑜 − 𝑃𝑐/ 100 − 𝑃𝑐)] × 100</p>
<p class="text-justify">𝑃𝑜 = 𝑂𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦</p>
<p class="text-justify">𝑃𝑐 = 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦</p>
<p class="text-justify">Plant extract concentration-mortality relationships are commonly expressed as a median lethal concentration (LC50). When plotting percent mortality against the corresponding log of concentration, this is the concentration that causes half of the test subjects to die after a particular exposure time [25].</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p class="text-justify">These findings support the use of Bangkiling Leaves extract as a plant-based chemotherapeutic agent. Nutrients like amino acids and carbohydrates are found in it, as well as flavonoids and phytosterols. Based on the Onion Root Tip and Brine Shrimp Lethality Assays, Bangkiling Leaves Extract has high DPPH scavenging, mitotic arresting, and cytotoxic activity. The results show that Bangkiling Leaf Extract is as potent as commercial colchicine tablets. Bangkiling Leaves and Ascorbic Acid both scavenged free radicals equally. The amount of Bangkiling leaves extracted does not affect brine shrimp mortality. The extract of Bangkiling leaves also inhibits free radicals.</p>
<hr />
<br><br>
<h2 id="Recommendations">Recommendations</h2><p class="text-justify">The researchers suggest using Bangkiling (Phyllanthus acidus) leaves as an alternative cancer treatment to help cancer patients. Its antioxidant properties help prevent cancer, colds, bronchitis, and asthma. The researchers recommend more research on Phyllanthus acidus (Bangkiling) leaves. In order to find the most effective concentration of Bangkiling leaves extract and commercial product, the researchers suggest repeating the DPPH and onion root tip assays.</p>
