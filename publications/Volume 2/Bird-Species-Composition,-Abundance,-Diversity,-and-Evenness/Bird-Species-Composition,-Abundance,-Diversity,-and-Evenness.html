<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract </h2><p class="text-justify">This study assessed bird species composition, abundance, diversity, evenness, and  species dominance in Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium and Provincial Capitol Park and  Lagoon. The point transect method was employed for 7 stations plotted in both locales.  Five hundred eleven (511) bird individuals were recorded comprising thirty (30) species.  Six (6) were endemic, nineteen (19) were residents, three (3) were introduced, and two (2)  were migrants. Only one recorded species, <em>Lonchura oryzivora</em>, an introduced species in  the Philippines and native to Indonesia, was endangered under the IUCN classification,  while <em>Passer montanus</em> is the most abundant in both sites. The assessment also revealed  that Panaad Park and Stadium had a higher diversity index and dominance of species  while Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon had a much even distribution of the  composition of species. By habitat assessment, Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium have a  better index in distance to the nearest road, number of trees, and tree height than  Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon which was closer to water. Moreover, study results  will be used as baseline information in strengthening the urban management in Negros  Occidental with an emphasis on bird diversity. </p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction </h2><p class="text-justify">Birds have a variety of roles in ecosystems, including predators, pollinators,  scavengers, seed dispersers, seed predators, and ecosystem engineers, among others  (Whelan et al., 2008). They are sensitive to environmental changes and can be  bioindicators of environmental health (Ferenc et al., 2014; Lepczyk &amp; Warren, 2012).  Though birds are the most prominent urban wildlife species, humans have a detrimental  impact on their natural habitat due to various activities including deforestation, roads,  the energy sector (renewable and coal), mining, climate change, and recently  urbanization (Scanes, 2018; Evans et al., 2009; Strohbach et al., 2009; Rodricks, 2018). In 2020, over 50% of the world&#39;s population lives in urban areas making  urbanization persistent and the largest threat to bird diversity (World Bank, 2022; United  Nations, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Isaksson et al., 2018; Open Forum: The Evolution of Urban  Life, n.d.). Population growth makes cities more centralized and increases urban areas.  Inherent are habitat fragmentation, loss, and change for numerous species (Marzluff,  2001). Species richness reduces with increasing urbanization (Jasmani et al., 2016;  Sandström et al., 2006). However, urbanized cities can still support bird diversity with  vegetation remnants and green spaces like parks (Callaghan et al., 2018). Urban  landscapes like parks are proven biodiversity hotspots and research on these areas  provides the most recent status of bird diversity (Gatesire et al., 2014). Previous studies have raised efforts to conserve birds, especially in highly  urbanized cities. Vallejo et al. (2008) and Yuan et al. (2018) recognized that green spaces  in urbanized areas host patterns of bird diversity. Other studies used park and green  space characteristics to relate with and predict bird diversity (Huang et al., 2022;  Thomson et al, 2022, Vasquez and Wood, 2022; Callaghan et al., 2018). Yang et al. (2020),  found that park size, habitat diversity, and distance to the city center emerged as the most  effective positive predators of bird species richness. Vegetation density, amount and area  of green space, and available bodies of water were other determinants of bird diversity  in urban green spaces (Dale, 2018; Khera et al., 2009; Chamberlain et al., 2007). The potential of green spaces in highly urbanized cities is recognized, and efforts  to conserve and manage biodiversity led the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)  to craft the City Biodiversity Index (CBI), an instrument for the conservation and  management of biodiversity (Kohsaka &amp; Uchiyama, 2013). Its adoption in Philippine  urban biodiversity has already been part of discussions for sustainability schemes in  urbanized areas (Delima-Baron, 2022). One indicator of CBI is the documentation of  native bird species in the city and how they are conserved (Uchiyama et al., 2015). In  Negros Occidental, local government units now prioritize urban planning with emphasis  on native biodiversity specifically birds. Though an integral requirement, bird profile still  needs to be studied in its most urbanized city, Bacolod, and the dearth of comprehensive  surveys in the locale is evident in the literature. In this study, bird species composition, abundance, diversity, evenness, and  species dominance in Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium and Provincial Capitol Park and  Lagoon are assessed. Results can provide baseline information on native bird diversity in  the city and generate insights for local sustainability actions, a step towards complying  with city biodiversity indicators. </p>

<h2 id="Methodology">Methodology </h2><p class="text-justify">The bird diversity at Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium and Provincial Capitol  Park and Lagoon were assessed via the point transect method and the use of a bird  guidebook (Jakosalem et al., 2019, unpublished). As shown in Figure 1, both sites are  located in Bacolod City, a highly urbanized city in Central Philippines. Bird observations were done 3 to 4 times a week from May 2022 to June 2022  within a valid period adherent to Wildlife Gratuitous Permit No. R6-2014-001 issued by the Office of the Regional Executive Director of DENR, Iloilo City.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid" src="img/Figure 1.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p class="text-justify"><em>Figure 1: Map of the Philippines, Negros Island, and survey sites taken from Google Earth: Panaad Park and Stadium and Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon.</em> </p>
<p class="text-justify">Used equipment are DSLR Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm and Samsung WB100 4.0-104.0mm camera, tabular list of birds found in the locale, Nikon Monarch M511 10×42 5.5° binoculars, a Nikon Prostaff P511 10×42 5.6° binocular, Celestron 22-66×100 Spotting Scope, Benro Tripod, bird transect form, measuring tape, Google Maps/Earth, photographic and bird guide of birds of Negros, Panay, and Cebu. </p>
<p class="text-justify">Several practice surveys were done to discover any possible concerns and limits in the study site (Hostetler &amp; Main, 2001). Digiscoping was also employed using a phone and a spotting scope to capture the images of species. Moreover, non-colorful clothes were used to avoid attracting or warning other birds (Hostetler &amp; Main, 2001).</p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="Point">Point Transect Method and Bird Observations Using Point Counts</h3><p class="text-justify">The Point transect method was used instead of the line transect. The former is better when surveying a larger element of bird fauna and is easier when identifying birds that are perching since observers stay at one point at a time duration (Bibby et al., 1998). </p>
<p class="text-justify">In the point transect method, six (6) stations, 250 meters apart from each other are plotted in Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium, and one (1) station in Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon (Hostetler &amp; Main, 2001; Emlen, 1977). </p>
<p class="text-justify">Using a satellite imagery map from Google Earth, the area of both sites was assessed and locations of predetermined stations were established.  Plot points were set in the Google map to indicate the location of every station. Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude) per station in both sites are shown in Tables 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Birds were observed in each station while recording the species’ frequency of sightings, general bird movement, and behavior across the route in the transect form sheets (Vallejo et al., 2009). Birds are only recorded if they entered within a 30-meter radius of each station and flying birds are excluded (Hostetler &amp; Main, 2001).</p>
<p class="text-justify">The observers were divided into two groups and assigned to 3 stations each as a measure to avoid double encounters. Each team consisted of two (2) observers with separate 180-degree angle field of view to ensure whole area observation and one (1) writer to encode the data recorded in a data sheet. Each survey lasted for five (5) minutes then proceeded to the next station. When listing or recording the data in the datasheet, tallying was avoided. </p>

<h3 id="Site">Site Description </h3><p class="text-justify">Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium. The Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium is a  25-hectare area with approximately 6,000 trees, a suitable habitat for birds. Buildings and  facilities are found within the area that are used for events and recreational activities. The  site is also near major roads and a river.  Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon. The Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon is  a 3.87-hectare area surrounded by major roads. It is a rectangular-shaped park with trees  together with a lagoon at the center. It is a recreational area surrounded by tall buildings  and condominiums. </p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="Habitat">Habitat Description  </h3><p class="text-justify">Parameters were measured to determine habitat characteristics and features that  potentially intervene with bird diversity. Parameters include tree trunk diameter at breast  height (Stagoll et al., 2012); distance of each adjacent tree; tree height; distance from the  nearest busy road, and distance from the nearest body of water. </p>

<br><br>
<h3 id="Bacolod">Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium. </h3><p class="text-justify">On average tree trunk diameter at breast  height, station 5 has the thickest, while station 1 has the least. Station 1 has trees with the  closest distance to each other, while in Station 4, trees have the farthest distances. There  are two (2) busy roads outside Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium. Station 4 is the nearest  to a busy road with a 650-meter distance while station 1 with a 1,030-meter distance from  a busy road is the farthest. The closest station to the nearest body of water is station 2.  </p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="Provincial">Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon. </h3><p class="text-justify">The average tree trunk diameter at breast  height is 1.93 m with an average distance to each adjacent tree of 8.25. The distance of the  nearest busy road is measured only from the North, East, and West because the road in  the South is not busy. The sum of the distances was divided by three (3) to determine the  average. Lastly, the distance from the nearest body of water is estimated at 65 m from  station 1 to the center of the lagoon.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid" src="img/Table 4.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p class="text-justify">In Table 4, a habitat assessment data summary in both sites is provided to provide  insights for developing an index to evaluate the security of the city’s biodiversity. In  Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon, trees are thicker in diameter at breast height  compared to those in Panaad Park and Stadium, although Panaad had greater estimated  tree height and number of trees compared to Lagoon. Both locales have a slightly similar  distance to the nearest body of water but Panaad Park and Stadium are significantly  closer while Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon are nearer to busy roads compared to  Panaad Park and Stadium.  </p>
<p class="text-justify">Despite having more infrastructures, vegetation is abundant in Panaad Park and  Stadium since it has a wider area and more space for propagation, making it a better  habitation for the birds than Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon. </p>
<hr />
<br><br>
<h2 id="Data">Data Analysis</h2><p class="text-justify">To compare and measure the diversity index (H′), the researchers used the  Shannon - Weiner equation (Gatesire et al., 2014). This index is a way to measure the  diversity of species in a community and it is defined by the number of individuals  observed for each species in the environment. The Shannon - Weiner Diversity Index is  calculated using this formula: </p>
<p class="text-justify">H = -Σpi * ln(pi) </p>
<p class="text-justify">Where H’ is the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Pi is the proportion of each  species in a sample, and LN (Pi) is the natural logarithm of the proportion (Paguntalan et  al., 2020). The Shannon Equitability Index is a method of determining the species&#39; equality  in a community. This refers to the degree to which the abundances of various species in  a community are similar. It is denoted as EH which is calculated using this formula:  </p>
<p class="text-justify">EH = H/ln(S) </p>
<p class="text-justify">Where (H) is the Shannon Diversity Index and the natural logarithm of the total  number of species (k). </p>

<h3 id="Adequacy">Adequacy of Sampling</h3><p class="text-justify"><img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid" src="img/Figure 4.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p class="text-justify">The record of bird observations is included in the bird species checklist used for data analysis. The sample data from observations resembled the baseline for the researchers to decide whether to cease the data collection once the data saturates.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Based on the figure above, the data saturates earlier for Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon than for Bacolod City Panaad Park and Stadium. Day 1 of conducting the bird survey in Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon started with 7 recorded species and continued to increase until Day 5. However, the number of species didn’t increase from Day 6 and reached its plateau of 15 recorded species on Day 7. In Bacolod City Panaad Park and Stadium, the bird checklist started with 19 bird species and it added more species in the following days. Day 4 has 30 recorded bird species and reached its plateau on Day 7.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid" src="img/Figure 5.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p class="text-justify">The composition of bird species of both locales (Figure 5), are 19 residents, 6 endemic, 3 introduced, and 2 migrant species, consistent with the trend from accounts of Banzon et al., (2022) Medina and Cabras (2018), and Vallejo et al., (2008). Endemic bird species consist of the Philippine Glossy Swiftlet, Philippine Coucal, Philippine Pied Fantail, Chestnut-crowned Tailorbird, Low-land White-eye, and Philippine Magpie-robin. Introduced bird species are composed of Crested Myna, Java Sparrow, and Eurasian  Tree Sparrow. The (2) two migrant species are the Philippine Brown Shrike and Barn Swallow, also documented in the green spaces of Davao City (Banzon et al., 2022).</p>
<p class="text-justify"><img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid" src="img/Figure 6.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p class="text-justify">The abundance of birds is totaled for both locales. Eurasian Tree Sparrow is the most abundant bird species (118) followed by the Red-turtle Dove (91), the Chestnut Munia (58), the Garden Sunbird (43), and the Philippine Pied Fantail (36). The Eurasian Tree Sparrow is a very common bird species in both locales, they fly or perch in groups in trees, buildings, and on the ground. In the study of Banzon et al., (2022) and Ong et al., (2007), it was also the most encountered species. Its abundance is attributed to its adaptation in highly disturbed areas that eventually allow it to dominate.</p>

<h3 id="New">New Island Record</h3><p class="text-justify"><img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid" src="img/Figure 7.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p class="text-justify"><em>Figure 7: Lowland White-eye perching on a branch at Panaad Park and Stadium Photos by: Godfrey Philip C.Jakosalem</em></p>
<p class="text-justify">Lowland white-eyes or <em>Zosterops meyeni</em> were spotted at both locales. This bird species was observed to be gathering in small groups perching around the branches of trees and also seen by themselves or in pairs and frequently transferred to other spaces. Four (4) Lowland white eyes were spotted at the Provincial Capitol Park &amp; Lagoon, and one (1) was spotted in Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium. In total, the number of Lowland white-eyes spotted was a new island record in Negros Occidental. </p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="Bird">Bird Checklist</h3><p class="text-justify">A total of 30 different bird species were spotted both in Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium and Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon, lower than the 31 species recorded by Banzon et al. (2022), 33 species by Vallejo et al. (2008), and 47 species documented by Ong et al. (2007), from green spaces in the Philippines. Twenty-nine (29) bird species are classified as LC or Least Concerned and only one species (<em>Lonchura oryzivora)</em> is classified as Endangered (iucnredlist.org) found on station 1 of Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium. Furthermore, in the Brinkman et al. (2023) bird checklist, the Java Sparrow (<em>Lonchura oryzivora)</em> is also classified as an Introduced species in the Philippines. They are mostly seen in groups and they perch around tall grass and bushes. BirdLife International (2020), considers it a species of global conservation concern with a very low rate of occurrence. Records of its occurrences along green spaces were also found in Thaweepworadej and Evans (2022) and Rosyadi et al., (2019). Additionally, birds in the checklist are classified as Least Concerned or LC in the DENR classification. (Brinkman et al., 2023)</p>
<p class="text-justify">The most abundant species in Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium are the Eurasian Tree Sparrow, Red Turtle Dove, Chestnut Munia, and Pied Fantail, while the Eurasian Tree Sparrow, Crested Myna, and Starling are the most abundant in the Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon.</p>

<p class="text-justify"><img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid" src="img/Table 5.2.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p class="text-justify">A bird checklist is made to take note of species in both locales. There are 30 bird species in Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium and 15 bird species in Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon. However, birds that are seen flying are included in the bird checklist but removed in the data analysis where their relative abundances are calculated. Therefore, there are 9 species recorded for Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon and 27 species for Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium. </p>
<p class="text-justify">In the results, Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium recorded the highest number of species than Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon where 8 species were seen or observed in both locales. These 8 species consist of the Red Turtle Dove, Zebra Dove, Collared Kingfisher, Philippine Pied Fantail, Low-land White-eye, Asian Glossy Starling, Chestnut Munia, and Eurasian Tree Sparrow. However, 19 observed species in Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium were not recorded in the Provincial Park and Lagoon (Table 5). These 19 species are composed of Philippine Glossy Swiftlet, Philippine Coucal, Rusty-breasted Cuckoo, Black-crowned Night-heron, Little Egret, Brahminy Kite, White-throated Kingfisher, Pied Triller, White-breasted Woodswallow, Philippine Brown-Shrike, Chestnut Crowned Tailorbird, Striated Grassbird, Barn Swallow, Pacific/Tahiti Swallow, Philippine Yellow-vented Bulbul, Philippine Magpie-robin, Garden sunbird, Scaly-breasted Munia, Java Sparrow. Although Black-crowned night herons and Little Egrets are known and always seen perching in Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon, they are not recorded during the observation because the survey conducting time is set for late afternoon and they perch when there is no visible sunlight.</p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="strong">strong</h3><p class="text-justify"><img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid" src="img/Table 6.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p class="text-justify">Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium have a higher diversity index (H’=2.40) with a total number of 27 species compared to Provincial Capitol Park &amp; Lagoon with a diversity index of (H’=2.04), and only 9 species. The high avifaunal diversity index of Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium compared to Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon can be attributed to its size, as larger parks attract more bird species (Murgui, 2007), provide more ecological space, habitat complexity, better food source, and conducive space for bird communities (Oliver et al., 2011; Evans et al., 2009). According to Schütz and Schulze, (2015), park size is a very important parameter in bird taxonomic and functional diversity metrics. In other studies, park size positively influenced bird diversity (Huang et al., 2022; Leveau et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2020; Murgui, 2007; Cornelis and Hermy, 2004; Fernández-Juricic and Jokimäki 2001).</p>
<p class="text-justify">On the distribution of species, where a value closer to 1 is more even, the Provincial Capitol Park &amp; Lagoon has a much even distribution (0.93) compared to Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium having a (0.73) evenness value. The result is parallel to Thompson et al. (2022), which found that evenness was significantly higher in large parks. Food availability can also explain distribution and evenness variability (Tu et al., 2020). Lastly, Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium have greater dominance of species (D’=0.12) than Provincial Capitol Park &amp; Lagoon (D’=0.13). </p>
<p class="text-justify">The diversity index values imply the diversity of bird species in both locales, however, there are bird families with species that are dominant in the said locale<strong>.</strong> In Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium, the most dominant family is the Estrildidae which has 3 species. The 3 species are composed of Scaly-breasted Munia, Chestnut Munia, and Java Sparrow. The Columbidae, Ardeidae, Alcedinidae, Hirundinidae, and Sturnidae families have at least 2 species while the remaining ones have one (1) species.</p>

<h3 id="Dominant">Dominant Bird Families</h3><p class="text-justify"><img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid" src="img/Figure 8.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p class="text-justify">The Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon has 3 dominant families that have 2 numbers of species which are composed of <em>Columbidae, Ardeidae</em>, and <em>Sturnidae</em>. The <em>Columbidae</em> family consists of Red Turtle-dove and Zebra Dove, the <em>Ardeidae</em> family contains Black-crowned night heron and Little Egret, and the <em>Sturnidae</em> family includes Crested Myna and Glossy Starling. The same families had common and abundant species in the records of Banzon et al. (2022), Serrano et al. (2019), and Vallejo et al (2009). </p>

<br><br>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p class="text-justify">The Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium had a higher species richness and diversity compared to Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon, with 27 and 9 observed species respectively. Despite similarities in the observed species for both sites, the larger size and better habitat characteristics of Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium such as Distance to the Nearest Road, Number of Trees, and Tree Height likely contributed to its higher diversity index. </p>
<p class="text-justify">Notably, the Philippine Glossy Swiftlet <em>Collocalia marginata</em> was the most commonly seen species at Provincial Capitol Park and Lagoon while the Eurasian Tree Sparrow <em>Passer montanus</em> had the highest number of species seen at the Bacolod Panaad Park and Stadium.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The presence of the Lowland white-eyes (Zosterops meyeni), a new island record, further underscores the importance of these habitats for avian biodiversity. Management efforts should focus on maintaining and enhancing these habitats to support the diverse bird species present, especially considering the EN (Endangered) classification of one species in the area.</p>
<hr />
<br><br>
<h2 id="Recommendations">Recommendations </h2><p class="text-justify">More surveys should be done in both sites to further identify other bird species. Continued monitoring of bird diversity, evenness, and distribution is also encouraged. Since the study is a baseline for the bird diversity profile in an urbanized city of Negros Occidental, it offers insights into the urban planning management of the provincial government which should look into the establishment of more green spaces and urban environmental hotspots in the city.</p>
